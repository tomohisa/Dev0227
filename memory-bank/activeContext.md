# Active Context: School Management System

## Current Focus

The School Management System is currently in active development with a focus on implementing the core functionality for managing students, teachers, and classes. The system uses the Sekiban event sourcing framework with a Blazor web frontend.

### Active Development Areas

1. **Core Domain Implementation**
   - Student management (registration, updates, deletion)
   - Teacher management (registration, updates, deletion)
   - Class management (creation, updates, deletion)
   - Relationship management between entities

2. **User Interface Development**
   - Responsive Blazor components
   - Modal-based forms for data entry
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Tabular data presentation

3. **Event Sourcing Infrastructure**
   - Command handling and validation
   - Event projection and state management
   - Query optimization
   - Orleans integration

## Recent Changes

1. **Student Management**
   - Implemented student registration, update, and deletion

   - Created UI components for student management

2. **Teacher Management**
   - Implemented teacher registration, update, and deletion
   - Added teacher-to-class assignment functionality
   - Created UI components for teacher management

3. **Class Management**
   - Implemented class creation, update, and deletion
   - Added student and teacher assignment to classes
   - Created UI components for class management

4. **UI Enhancements**

   - Ensuring responsive UI

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Using Playwright for end-to-end testing
   - Implementing page object models
   - Testing critical user flows
   - Ensuring cross-browser compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term Tasks**
   - Enhance search and filtering capabilities
   - Implement batch operations for efficiency
   - Add data export functionality
   - Improve error handling and user feedback

2. **Medium-term Goals**
   - Implement reporting functionality
   - Add user authentication and authorization
   - Enhance data visualization
   - Implement advanced filtering and sorting

3. **Long-term Vision**
   - Extend to additional educational entities (courses, departments)
   - Implement academic performance tracking
   - Add scheduling and calendar functionality
   - Integrate with external systems

## Open Questions
