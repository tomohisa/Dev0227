## Lessons Learned

### Domain Testing

1. **Sekiban Testing Approach**
   - Sekiban provides a powerful in-memory testing framework
   - The SekibanInMemoryTestBase class simplifies domain testing
   - The Given-When-Then pattern works well for event sourcing tests
   - Domain tests can be fast and reliable without database dependencies

2. **Source Generation Considerations**
   - Sekiban uses source generation to create domain types
   - Tests must reference the correct namespaces (SchoolManagement.Domain.Generated)
   - SchoolManagementDomainDomainTypes is generated at build time
   - No need to create custom domain type classes for testing

3. **Testing Patterns**
   - Command tests verify that commands produce the expected events
   - Projector tests verify that events are correctly applied to build state
   - Relationship tests verify that entity connections are maintained
   - State transition tests verify that entities change state correctly

4. **Test Organization**
   - Separate test classes for each entity (Student, Teacher, Class)
   - Dedicated test class for relationship validation
   - Tests follow a consistent pattern for readability
   - Test names clearly describe the behavior being tested

### Frontend Development

1. **Next.js and React**
   - Next.js provides a modern, responsive frontend framework

   - Form validation is critical for data integrity

3. **API Integration**
   - API clients should be organized by entity type
   - Error handling is essential for a good user experience
   - Form validation should occur before API calls

   - **NEW**: BFF pattern improves security and performance
   - **NEW**: Server actions provide a clean way to handle server-side operations

4. **Theme Support**
   - Dark mode support enhances user experience
   - Theme switching should be persistent
   - UI components should adapt to theme changes
